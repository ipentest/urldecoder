# urldecoder
Most of the url encoders and decoders I've used encode ALL of the characters we supply within the input... 
But what we want is only the URL-sensitive characters to be encoded, hence this project

The best way to use this is to make an offline copy of the index.html page and call it locally in your browser... That's it
